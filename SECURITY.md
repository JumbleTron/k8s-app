# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is important to us. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Do not create a public issue** for the vulnerability.
2. Instead, send an email to security@kielniakodu.io with a description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.
3. We will respond as quickly as possible to acknowledge receipt and discuss next steps.

## Supported Versions

We typically provide security fixes for the following versions of the project:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |

## Handling Process

After receiving a report:

1. We will confirm receipt of the report.
2. We will verify the report and determine its impact.
3. We will develop a fix and implement it for supported versions.
4. After releasing the fix, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability, giving credit to the reporter (unless otherwise requested).

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
